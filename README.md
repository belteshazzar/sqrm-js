# sqrm

sqrm (pronounced squirm) is markdown, but re-imagined from a clean sheet. There are two main differences between sqrm and markdown:

1. indenting is important -- sqrm supports nesting html divs; and
2. hashtags -- sqrm uses hashtags like your use on twitter, they are fundamental to server side and client side processing.
