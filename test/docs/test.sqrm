<div class="custom-class" markdown="1">
  <div>
    nested div
  </div>
  <script type='text/x-koka'>
    function( x: int ) { return x*x; }
  </script>
  This is a div _with_ underscores
  and a & <b class="bold">bold</b> element.
  <style>
    body { font: "Consolas" }
  </style>
</div>

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by
whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**,
and `code()`. Note that underscores
in_words_are ignored.



````dafny
  method Foo() {
    requires "github style code blocks"
  }
````

````application/json
  { value: ["or with a mime type"] }
````

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

And a block

Text with
two trailing spaces
(on the right)
can be used
for things like poems

== Markdown plus tables

| Header | Header | Right  |
| ------ | ------ | -----: |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)

= Markdown plus definition lists

* Multiple definitions and terms are possible
* Definitions can include multiple paragraphs too
